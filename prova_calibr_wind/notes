On the roof of U9

We want to compare the outputs of the Trisonica anemometer with the obs of the weather station.
By default the weather station saves data with a frequency of 5 minutes (averages every 5 minutes). There is an offset of an hour and some minutes between the local time (e.g. 15:00) and the laptop time (13:57).
The difference in time steps does not allow for a proper validation.
