scope sym=570-639

SYM570 lat: LATITUDE, Latitude, , Latitude as degrees in WGS-84 datum (with decimals)
SYM571 lon: LONGITUDE, Longitude, , Longitude as degrees in WGS-84 datum (with decimals)
SYM572 pos: POSITION, GNSS position, , Global position
SYM573 alt: ALTITUDE, Altitude, meter, Geopotential altitude above mean sea level (MSL)
SYM574 sats: GPS_SATELLITES, GPS Satellites, , Number of satellites used for fix
SYM575 hdop: GPS_HDOP, GPS HDOP, meter, Horizontal Dilution Of Precision
SYM576 dir: COURSE, Course, angleDeg, Course -- travelling towards this direction with 'spd' speed. This can differ from heading. 0 = moving towards N, 90 = towards E
SYM577 spd: SPEED, Speed, meterPerSec, Speed of the vehicle relative to ground
SYM578 externalGnss: EXTERNAL_GNSS, External GNSS receiver, bool, Whether to use an external GPS instead of an internal one

SYM579 orQuaW: ORIENTATION_QUATERNION_W, Orientation quaternion W, , Conversion from global to local frame. Component also known as 'A' or real part.
SYM580 orQuaX: ORIENTATION_QUATERNION_X, Orientation quaternion X, , Conversion from global to local frame. Component also known as 'B'.
SYM581 orQuaY: ORIENTATION_QUATERNION_Y, Orientation quaternion Y, , Conversion from global to local frame. Component also known as 'C'.
SYM582 orQuaZ: ORIENTATION_QUATERNION_Z, Orientation quaternion z, , Conversion from global to local frame. Component also known as 'D'.

SYM583 roll: ROLL, Roll angle, angleDeg, "Bank". Side-wise angle. Assumes the sensor is aligned with the body. Compared to global frame.
SYM584 pitch: PITCH, Pitch angle, angleDeg, "Attack angle". Assumes the sensor is aligned with the body. Compared to global frame.

SYM585 heading: HEADING, Heading, angleDeg, The direction the craft is facing. Same as yaw. Degree between 0 and 360. If the craft is drifting this can be different from the course the craft is travelling in practice.
